//! Native MuJoCo integration owned by the independent simulator application.
//!
//! The default build contains only closed-model artifact validation and digesting.
//! Enable the `native` feature to compile MJCF with the pinned `mujoco-rs`
//! binding and use the native `Model`, `Workspace`, and `Scene` types.
//!
//! `Scene` is the sole owner of authoritative mutable physics data exposed by
//! this crate.
//! `Workspace` is an explicitly non-authoritative computation owner suitable
//! for a service that has chosen native model access.
//! `Model` is immutable after compilation and can be shared with read-only
//! consumers.
